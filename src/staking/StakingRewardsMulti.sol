/**
 * @title Yearn Vault Staking MultiRewards
 * @author YearnFi
 * @notice Modified staking contract that allows users to deposit vault tokens and receive multiple different reward
 *  tokens, and also allows depositing straight from vault underlying via the StakingRewardsZap. Only the owner
 *  role may add new reward tokens, or update rewardDistributor role of existing reward tokens.
 *
 *  This work builds on that of Synthetix (StakingRewards.sol) and CurveFi (MultiRewards.sol).
 *  Synthetix info: https://docs.synthetix.io/contracts/source/contracts/stakingrewards
 *  Curve MultiRewards: https://github.com/curvefi/multi-rewards/blob/master/contracts/MultiRewards.sol
 * @dev This would be equivalent to StakingRewardsMulti.sol (https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2793323b14990c1c9df7444cd5c4207ca61c258),
 *  except for downgrading the Solidity version from 0.8.19 to 0.8.18.
